* It was an early project made for understanding how the PyGame module worked.

#### Additional Notes
* Might have been better if there was a high score system
* The snake's head doesn't have a directional movement information such as eyes or a face
* When the body becomes larger the tail gets mixed with the other yellow squares and movement can't be predicted.
